This database is architected to support a brokerage firm's analytical needs by tracking client trading activity.   
The schema is built on four core, interrelated tables. The Users table contains essential client information, 
while the Stocks table catalogs all tradable assets. At the heart of the system, the Transactions table logs
every historical buy and sell action, providing a complete audit trail. To complement this, the Holdings 
table offers a current snapshot of each user's portfolio. By linking these tables through foreign keys,
the design effectively separates historical data from current ownership, enabling powerful and
efficient analytical queries.
